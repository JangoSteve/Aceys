# The Aceys

This is a Ruby/Sinatra web application for anonymous voting for any competition. It was developed by [Alfa Jango Web-based Software](http://www.alfajango.com) to facilitate a sort of "People's Choice" awards for the [Annual Collaboration for Entrepreneurship event](http://ace-event.org) and can be found at [TheAceys.com](http://www.theaceys.com).

This app was developed specifically for being deployed to Heroku's cloud
platform. See instructions below for cloning this applicaiton and
deploying for your own use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here is a sample/template sinatra application ready for deployment to [Heroku](http://heroku.com).

**NOTE** This is for heroku.com and not herokugarden.com

* Create an acount in seconds at [Heroku](http://heroku.com/signup).
* Install the gem `sudo gem install heroku`.
* If you do not have an SSH key
you'll need to [generate
one](http://heroku.com/docs/index.html#_setting_up_ssh_public_keys)
and [tell Heroku about
it](http://heroku.com/docs/index.html#_manage_keys_on_heroku)
* Clone this repo `git clone git://github.com/sinatra/heroku-sinatra-app [appname]`
* `cd /path/to/project`
* `heroku create [optional-app-name]` (You can rename your app with `heroku rename`)
* `git push heroku master`

**NOTES**

The small amount of code is heavily commented. If you have questions
or comments please use [the channels provided](http://www.sinatrarb.com/contributing.html) by the Sinatra community as
we at Heroku are heavily involved in Sinatra.  Please use the Heroku [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/heroku) if you
have non Sinatra questions.

See [these guidelines](http://www.sinatrarb.com/contributing.html) for
contributing or bugs.

Happy Development and Deploying!

Sincerely,
The Heroku Team
